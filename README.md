# OSU Research Type Library

Low level type library used by The Ohio State University Office of Research applications.

This package provides type objects for typical scalars (Text, Numerics, DateTimes) and domain-specific types commonly used across our application suite (Person, EducationalOccupationalCredential, DigitalDocument).

Types are often modeled from https://schema.org and W3C vocabularies to better promote interoperability with third party software.
